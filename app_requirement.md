Chotu App

Problem:
Currently my son watches some youtube videos while eating, and sometimes to fall asleep. Though watching videos is not good, what's worse are some videos on youtube that are purpose built for grabbing eyeballs of toddlers by adding colors and shapes without any story or message in it. Such videos keep showing up in recommendation and my son wants to watch those over the good videos, which I want him to watch. 

Solution:
I want to build a simple mobile based website that would only have the youtube embedded videos that I've pre-selected. At the end of each video, we can set an option in Youtube embed video to only show videos from the channel and not any random video. with that, I can ensure that my son watches videos from credible channels. 

How it should work?
This website should be connected to a CMS where the parent should be able to add links to the youtube videos that should show up on the app. 

The app (mobile web) design:
It should be a minimal design like the Youtube kids website which is just thumbnail of videos with option to play, and can be scrolled to find other videos.
